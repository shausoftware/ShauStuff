                 Form 3D is a geometric shape game/toy inspired by the DOS application Form by Andrew Rowbottom and the WINAMP screensaver Geiss by Ryan Geiss.
                 This Unity 4 game creates a pattern of simple 3D geometric forms whose relationships to each other can be changed by varying parameters (similar to Form).
                 Configuration parameters can be saved into slots where changing the current slot animates the geometric shapes into their new configuration.
                 This in conjunction with real-time manipulation of application parameters such as the camera (using keyboard shortcuts) creates visual candy (a la Geiss). <br/>
                 When this page initially loads the game is running in a demo mode. To get going quickly set the focus to the Unity Player and press the <b>F</b> key to open the Form Builder tool.
                 To change the form colours and background skybox press the <b>P</b> key to open the colour palette.
