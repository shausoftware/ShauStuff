                Virtual Trigger is an Audio Unit I'm developing that triggers MIDI note events 
                when a threshold amplitude of an audio signal is exceeded. I initially developed the trigger on hardware using an op-amp
                circuit I designed and an Arduino as the controller and MIDI event generator (I hope to get the code and circuit diagrams onto Github soon).
                It works well, so I decided to port it to a software based solution. 
                The plug-in in it's current state runs as an Audio Unit Effect and the screenshot below shows the Virtual Trigger 
                running in Apple Logic Pro X. To install the plug-in copy the file VirtualTrigger.component to either of the following folders: <br/>
                <br/>
                "&frasl;Library&frasl;Audio&frasl;Plug-Ins&frasl;Components" <br/>
                "~&frasl;Library&frasl;Audio&frasl;Plug-Ins&frasl;Components" <br/>
                <br/>
                This is very much a work in progress and my plan is develop this a lot further, with the ultimate aim of driving MIDI performances 
                from live performance. Please be aware that the MIDI is currently firing ahead of the audio that triggers it.
                My algorithms are sample accurate and ideally I would have liked to have used the Audio Unit MIDI output callback specification but unfortunately it
                seems like most hosts including Logic do not support it. Another approach I tried taking was to try and get the predicted host time of the individual samples 
                playback. Again I ran into issues as Logic only passes the sample time (not host time) in the AudioTimeStamp provided for each render, which would be great if 
                the MIDI callback functionality was available. In the end I had to take a huge compromise and provided a control to compensate for the early firing. As a result triggering 
                isn't sample accurate :(    
                As it doesn't seem possible to get this to run in any DAW the next step is to create a custom host that does supply the host time. The DSP 
                code for the plug-in can be found in my Github repository.
                Please read on for further information on the plug-ins functionality. <br/>
